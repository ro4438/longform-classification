  \caption{\acrlong{rfs} outperforms models based on word embeddings
    permutation-marginalized recurrent neural networks (denoted by LSTM) on meal
    recommendation. The recommendation models are trained on data from a food
    tracking app as described in \Cref{sec:experiments_meals} and are evaluated
    using the sampled recall metric, \Cref{eq:sampled-recall}. The inner
    product, neural network, and residual regression functions for \acrlong{rfs}
    are in \Cref{eqn:rankfromsets,eqn:neural-network,eqn:residual}.}
