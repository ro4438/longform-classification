\begin{abstract}
  Recommendation models suggest items to users. We study a variant of this task
  where each item has a set of attributes, such as tags on an image, user
  reactions to a post, or foods in a meal. We propose \acrlong{rfs}, a flexible
  and scalable model for recommending items with attributes. \acrlong{rfs}
  treats item attributes as side information and learns embeddings to
  discriminate items a user will consume from items a user is unlikely to
  consume. We develop theory connecting the \acrlong{rfs} loss to optimal recall
  and show that the learnable class of models for \acrlong{rfs} is a superset of
  several previously-proposed models. To scale \acrlong{rfs} to large datasets,
  we propose a stochastic optimization framework based on negative sampling.
  Within this framework, we suggest two specific approaches that trade off
  computation for accuracy. In experiments on two real-world datasets,
  \acrlong{rfs} outperforms competing approaches while also learning embeddings
  that reveal interpretable structure in user behavior.

  % Matrix factorization approaches that handle side-information exist, but they
  % cannot handle large attribute vocabularies. We consider recommending items
  % to users in the setting where items have bags of attributes.

  % % problem setup; why is this interesting; motivation - this data occurs often
  % Every day, users consume items made up of sets of attributes.
  % % examples of such data
  % A user might consume a meal that is a set of foods, or a document containing a
  % set of words.
  % % the task
  % We focus on building recommendation models that produce rankings of items
  % using their sets of attributes.
  % % there are many possible sets of attributes
  % But recommending items described by sets is difficult because of the large
  % number of sets.
  % % foreshadow desiderata
  % This means we cannot posit a model with unique parameters for
  % every set, and requires a model to share information across items with similar
  % sets of attributes.
  % % implicitly, sets are order invariant
  % Models whose output does not depend on the order that set elements are fed to
  % the model form the class of order-invariant models.
  % % contribution: we show that existing models the reader is used to fall in
  % % this class
  % We show that this class of order-invariant models encompasses existing
  % recommendation models such as matrix factorization and
  % permutation-marginalized recurrent neural networks.
  % % one way of evaluating is recall
  % One way to assess the performance of a recommendation model is with recall.
  % % contribution: recall is binary, we note that this leads to classification
  % Recall is inherently binary: a model does or does not recall an item.
  % % our algorithm is to fit the parameters via classification
  % This means we can fit a recommendation model's parameters using classification
  % to maximize the evaluation metric of recall. 
  % % contribution: we show it approximates other algorithms
  % We build \acrshort{rankfromsets}, a recommendation model that can approximate
  % any order-invariant model such as matrix factorization, and that theoretically
  % maximizes recall.
  % % contribution: we build a classifier with negative sampling
  % The model is a classifier parameterized by a neural network,
  % \acrshort{rankfromsets}, and we develop an algorithm that trains the model to
  % distinguish items a user consumes from items a user is unlikely to consume.
  % % contribution: we show it does well
  % Empirically, we show that this model outperforms other models on recommending
  % meals from the Lose It! app and recommending documents from the arXiv.
  % % Interpretability
  % We also find that the model reveals interpretable patterns in this user
  % behavior.
  % % code
  % Code for \acrshort{rankfromsets} is available at
  % \url{https://github.com/altosaar/rankfromsets}.
  % We consider the task of recommending items to users, where each item has a
  % set of attributes and user feedback is implicit.
  %   % Our goal is recommendation with implicit data, where each item has a set
  %   % of attributes.
  % For example, the item is a meal, the set a bag of foods composing the meal,
  % and the user implicitly prefers the meal by choosing to eat it. We develop
  % \acrshort{rankfromsets} (RFS), a flexible recommendation model that
  % transforms the recommendation problem into classification. RFS learns
  % attribute embeddings and an order-invariant prediction function that is used
  % to rank candidate items. Training an RFS model is performed through negative
  % sampling in a manner that provably maximizes recall.
  %   % Since our data is implicit, the negative labels need to be defined; we
  %   % draw from the uniform distribution over items. This algorithm and
  %   % negative sampling distribution is theoretically justified.
  %   % We prove that such a classifier maximizes recall.
  % \acrshort{rankfromsets} outperforms competing methods in empirical
  % evaluation and learn interpretable embeddings. Code is available at
