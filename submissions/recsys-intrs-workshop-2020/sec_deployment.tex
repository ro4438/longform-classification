\section{Deployment}

We deploy the visual interface using Github Pages, and deploy the backend recommendation model, \gls{rfs}, as a microservice hosted on Amazon Web Services Lambda. As \Cref{eq:inner-product-control} is cheap to compute, the lambda function is a short python script that simply requires numpy as a dependency, compared to \acrshort{bert} which would require a hosted GPU solution.
