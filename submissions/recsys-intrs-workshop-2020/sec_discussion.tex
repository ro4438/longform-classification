\section{Discussion}
\paragraph{Future Work.} Comparing to transformer-based models~\citep{devlin2019bert:} would help clarify how much performance is given up when choosing an efficient model such as \gls{rfs} for recommendations. For explainability beyond top words in an article contributing to a recommendation, it would be interesting to develop methods for enabling editors to search through interpretable latent dimensions. Building quantitative human-in-the-loop evaluation methods into a user interface may also help guide modeling choices. Finally, studying whether the transparency provided by open-source recommendation systems can improve user experience is an open problem.
